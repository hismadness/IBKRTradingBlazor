# IBKRTradingBlazor Project Status

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to convert an existing Blazor WebAssembly application (`IBKRTradingBlazor`) into a standalone, native Windows desktop application using .NET MAUI.

## Business Functionality and Rules

This application serves as a custom trading tool for the Interactive Brokers (IBKR) platform. The main goal is to provide a specialized interface for traders to manage their accounts and execute orders based on a predefined set of rules and strategies.

### Core Features:
*   **Account Management:** View account summaries and position details.
*   **Order History:** Review past trades and their performance.
*   **Pre-Market Trading:** A dedicated interface for placing orders before the market opens.
*   **Risk and Position Sizing:** Automated calculations to manage trade risk.

### Key Business Rules:
*   **Dynamic Risk Management:** The `RiskManager` implements a strategy where the trading risk percentage is adjusted based on recent performance. The risk is increased after two consecutive wins and decreased after two consecutive losses. The risk levels are set at 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%.
*   **Position Size Capping:** The `PositionSizeCalculator` can cap the trade quantity at 1% of the 20-day average volume to avoid liquidity issues.

## Current Status

*   **Project Creation:** A new .NET MAUI Blazor project, `IBKRTradingBlazor.Desktop`, has been successfully created and integrated into the solution.
*   **Code Migration:** All necessary UI components (`.razor` pages), data models, and business logic from the original `IBKRTradingBlazor.Client` project have been migrated to the new `IBKRTradingBlazor.Desktop` project.
*   **Build Success:** After extensive debugging of the build process, all compilation errors have been resolved. The `IBKRTradingBlazor.Desktop` project now builds successfully for the Windows target.
*   **Runtime Failure:** Despite the successful build, the application currently fails immediately upon launch. It displays a generic "unhandled error" message, but provides no specific exception details in the console logs, which has made it difficult to diagnose the root cause.
*   **Cleanup:** All lingering processes of the application have been terminated to ensure a clean state for the next debugging session.

## Missing Steps / Next Actions

The immediate and critical next step is to diagnose and resolve the runtime error that is causing the application to crash.

1.  **Attach a Debugger:** The most effective way to identify the root cause of the crash is to run the `IBKRTradingBlazor.Desktop` project with a debugger attached. This should be done from within Visual Studio.
2.  **Identify the Exception:** Launching the project in debug mode will allow the debugger to break at the exact point where the unhandled exception occurs, revealing the specific error message, stack trace, and the state of the application at the time of the crash.
3.  **Resolve the Runtime Error:** Once the exception is identified, the necessary code or configuration changes can be made to fix the issue.

By following these steps, we should be able to overcome this final hurdle and get the desktop application running successfully.
